## Overview
This chapter provides reference to Rampart Built-in and System Components. Rampart Built-in Components are intended to implement commonly used AIML application patterns. Rampart implements its own infrastructure as graph of Rampart System Components. The key difference between an application Rampart Graph and a System Rampart Graph is that the latter can only be deployed once on a Rampart cluster.
